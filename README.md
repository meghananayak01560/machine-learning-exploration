# Machine Learning Exploration

This repository contains my exploration of machine learning concepts through Python notebooks. These notebooks document my learning journey from basic mathematical foundations to more complex neural network implementations.

## Learning Journey

### [What is Machine Learning?](notes/what-is-ml.ipynb)
This notebook introduces the fundamental concepts of machine learning. I explore what machine learning is, different types of learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement), and basic terminology. It's a great starting point for understanding the field.

### [Data Structures for ML](notes/data-structs.ipynb)
Here I explore the essential data structures used in machine learning, focusing on how mathematical concepts translate into Python implementations. This notebook helped me understand how to organize and manipulate data effectively for ML applications.

### [Single Variable Calculus for ML](notes/derivative-single-var.ipynb)
This notebook revisits single variable calculus concepts with a focus on their applications in machine learning. I explore derivatives, optimization, and how these mathematical tools are fundamental to understanding machine learning algorithms.

### [Introduction to Neural Networks](notes/nn-intro.ipynb)
Building on my mathematical foundation, this notebook dives into the basics of neural networks. I explore how linear algebra concepts come together to create these powerful learning systems, including activation functions, layers, and basic network architectures.

### [Neural Network Forward and Backpropagation](notes/nn-forward-backprop.ipynb)
This is my most advanced notebook, where I implement and explain the forward and backpropagation algorithms in neural networks. I break down the mathematics behind how neural networks learn, including gradient descent and the chain rule in multivariable calculus.

## About Me
I'm a sophomore student majoring in Applied Mathematics, passionate about the intersection of mathematics and computer science. These notebooks represent my journey in understanding the mathematical foundations of machine learning. I'm particularly interested in how mathematical concepts can be applied to solve real-world problems through machine learning.
